In my courses, we use something called "Bloom’s taxonomy" to help us categorize and discuss the kinds of learning that students are expected to accomplish. While learning is a lot more complicated than a single chart can convey, I think it’s helpful to have shared language around what we’re aiming for.

A taxonomy is an ordered arrangement of categories.[^1] It can help us talk about complex and abstract ideas more clearly, as well as see relationships between ideas or things. 

Bloom's taxonomy[^2]  arranges categories of cognitive activities, especially those we use while learning. 

The categories, in order from least to most sophisticated cognitive activity, are:

1. 📘 remembering
2. 🚙 understanding
3. 🍏 applying
4. 🌼 analyzing
5. 📙 evaluating
6. 🎒 creating

Generally speaking, education systems are arranged so that students move through the levels of Bloom's taxonomy gradually, mostly in order. Think of it like this: you wouldn't expect yourself to write a book *(apply the rules of language & create new meanings)* before you can read one *(remember words & understand their meanings.)*

By the time you get to college, it is assumed that you will not only **remember** and **understand** the material assigned, but that you will also be able to **apply** and **analyze** what you learn. Advanced courses and graduate school then ask you to evaluate and create.

Of course, learning isn't strictly linear. 

[^1]: For example, a taxonomy of shapes ordered by number of sides would begin like this:
    1. circles
    2. triangles
    3. rectangles and other quadrilaterals
    4. pentagons
