Louis Le Prince patented a multi-lens motion picture camera in 1888 and, later that year, created a single-lens version. The camera used paper film stock. Le Prince filmed at least four short motion pictures in 1888; these are currently considered the oldest surviving motion pictures.

The next year, George Eastman's photography company began selling a flexible celluloid film stock that was more durable than paper. Eastman's company also created the first film roll system and the sprocket holes that allow film to be advanced inside the camera.
