## Invention of moving pictures
Louis Le Prince patented a multi-lens motion picture camera in 1888 and, later that year, created a single-lens version. The camera used paper film stock. Le Prince filmed at least four short scenes in 1887 and 1888; these are currently considered the oldest surviving motion pictures. 

The oldest sequence, known as "Man Walking Around a Corner," consists of 16 frames, shot with Le Prince's multi-lens camera. The next two sequences, "Roundhay Garden Scene" and "Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge," are 20 frames each, although the latter was almost certainly longer in its original. Both films survive only as photographed copies made in 1930.[^1]
