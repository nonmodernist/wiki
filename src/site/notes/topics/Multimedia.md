**Multimedia** refers to the integration of multiple forms of media, such as text, audio, images, video, and interactive elements, into a single platform or application.

Multimedia encompasses various types of content, each serving different purposes:

- **Text** - Fundamental to multimedia, providing context and information.
- **Audio** - Includes music, sound effects, and voiceovers that enhance the experience.
- **Images** - Static visual content, such as photographs and illustrations.
- **Video** and **Animation** - Moving images created from still pictures, often used in films, television, and video games to bring characters and stories to life.
- **Interactivity** - Includes hypertext and other elements with which the audience can interact.

Some definitions of multimedia position computers as an essential component, while others define multimedia as anything that combines multiple forms of media, whether they are computer-oriented or not.

Another way to categorize multimedia is according to linearity: some multimedia projects are linear, progressing without any navigational control, while others are non-linear, allowing the audience or user to choose their own path through the content. For example, *Super Mario Bros.* is an interactive multimedia video game that is nonetheless linear (there is only one ‚Äúpath‚Äù through the game). *Grand Theft Auto V*, on the other hand, is an interactive multimedia video game with both linear and non-linear elements.

## Rhetorical concepts in multimedia

### üåÄ Apparent motion

Despite being technologically distinct, animation, film, and video all rely on one essential principle: **apparent motion**. When similar images are shown in quick succession, human eyes and brains interpret the multiple images as a single, apparently moving image.

Apparent motion is the principle behind many [[topics/prehistory\|optical toys]] and other forms of early animation, as well as the [[topics/prehistory#üì∑ Photography\|earliest experiments in moving pictures]] conducted by [[Eadweard Muybridge\|Eadweard Muybridge]], [[Louis Le Prince\|Louis Le Prince]], and others.
