**Folk horror** is a genre of film and fiction that uses elements of folklore to invoke fear and foreboding.

Though the genre dates back to the silent era (*H√§xan*, 1922, Sweden), recent films like *Midsommar* (2019, US/Sweden), *La Llorona* (2019, Guatemala), and *The Medium*/‡∏£‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á‡∏ó‡∏£‡∏á *Rang Song* (2021, Thailand) demonstrate a renewed interest in folkloric horror stories from around the world.

As the editors of *Folk Horror: New Global Pathways* explain, ‚Äúfolk horror derives from folklore‚Äîfrom the roots of community and communal fears. And as such, one would assume that it has to be global, composed of variegated regional formations.‚Äù[^1]

In 2021, Kier-La Janisse and Severin Films released an extensive documentary about the history of folk horror, titled *Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched*, along with an accompanying boxset called *All the Haunts Be Ours*, which contains 20 feature films. In 2024, Severin Films followed this up with *All the Haunts Be Ours* volume 2, containing 24 feature films. Both boxsets also contain a wealth of special features, including interviews, short films, and more.

## ‚ú® Tropes

### Rural communities and locations

Folk horror stories often take place in rural communities and locations, such as **villages**[^1] or very **small towns**,[^2] **farms** and **fields**,[^3] **forests**,[^4] or **islands**.[^5]

[^1]: For example, in |white-reindeer|_ (1952, Finland), *Satan's Feats in the Village of Leva-e-Traz* (1967, Brazil), *Leptirica* (1973, Yugoslavia), *The Dark Secret of Harvest Home* (1978, US), *The Witch* (2015, US).
[^2]: *The Wailing* (2016, South Korea), *When Evil Lurks* (2023, Argentina).
[^3]: *Crowhaven Farm* (1970, US), *Blood on Satan's Claw* (1971, UK), *Children of the Corn* (1984, US), *A Field in England* (2013, UK).
[^4]: Kuroneko (1968, Japan), Eyes of Fire (1983, US), The Enchanted (1984), The Blair Witch Project (1999, US), Roh (2019, Malaysia).
[^5]: *The Wicker Man* (1972, UK), *Io Island* (1977, South Korea).

Films like *Lokis: A Manuscript of Professor Wittembach* (1970, Poland), *Let's Scare Jessica to Death* (1971, US), *Ganja & Hess* (1973, US), *The Ash Tree* (1975, UK), *The Rites of May* (1976, Philippines), and *La Llorona* (2019, Guatemala) locate their action primarily within a **large, isolated house** that operates as an outpost on the edge of a rural locale.

Others, like *Lake of the Dead* (1958, Norway), *Hour of the Wolf* (1968, Sweden), *Deliverance* (1972), *Butter on the Latch* (2015, US), and *Midsommar* (2019, US), take place during **vacations** or **festivals** in scenic rural locales.

*[[candyman\|Candyman]]* (1992, US) is a somewhat rare example of a folk horror film with an urban setting, although one could argue that the Cabrini-Green housing project in the film serves as the 1990s equivalent of a farm or other rural place‚Äîan isolated community suffering from what Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls ‚Äúorganized abandonment.‚Äù[^6]

Folk horror's focus on rurality connects to the 19th-century origins of folklore studies, when European ethnographers traveled to rural areas to collect folklore from illiterate, poor communities.

### The Outsider, Skeptic, or Ethnographer

Rural and isolated communities are thrown into relief by the arrival of an **outsider**[^7] or the presence of a **skeptic**.[^8] Sometimes this outsider is literally an **ethnographer** collecting folklore from the community,[^9] or an **archaeologist** or other academic studying ancient sites.[^10]

[^7]: Robin Redbreast (1970, UK), The Wicker Man (1972, UK), Children of the Corn (1984, US), Clearcut (1991, Canada).
[^8]: *Night of the Demon* (1957, UK), *Night of the Eagle* (1962, UK) *Whistle and I'll Come to You* (1968, UK).
[^9]: *The City of the Dead* (1960, UK), *Lokis* (1970, Poland), *The Savage Hunt of King Stakh* (1979, USSR), Candyman (1992, US), *The Medium* (2021, Thailand).
[^10]: *The Sign of Death* (1939, Mexico), *A Warning to the Curious* (1972, UK), *Children of the Stones* (1977, UK), *The Dreaming* (1988, Australia).

Dr. Dejan Ognjanovic points out that the trope of the outsider coming into a folk community is more common in Western or Anglicized folk horror. In Slavic folk horror, he argues, ‚Äúsomeone is already immersed in this value system, and whatever happens in this plot arises from within.‚Äù[^11]

### Ancient sacred sites

Characters visit ancient sacred sites for **research**,[^12] **rituals**,[^13] or simply as **tourists**.[^14]

[^12]: *Night of the Demon* (1957, UK), *Born of Fire* (1987, UK).
[^13]: *Blood on Satan's Claw* (1971, UK), *Alison's Birthday* (1981, Australia).
[^14]: *Picnic at Hanging Rock* (1975, Australia), *Lake Mungo* (2008, Australia).

Many horror films from settler colonial countries include the clich√© ‚ÄúIndian burial ground‚Äù trope, including *The Last Wave* (1977, Australia), *The Amityville Horror* (1979, US), *The Shining* (1980, US), *Eyes of Fire* (1983, US), *Kadaicha* (1988, Australia), *Pet Sematary* (1989, US), and *Grim Prairie Tales* (1990, US), to name just a few. But as Jesse Wente says, ‚Äúthere is no such thing as an Indian burial ground‚Ä¶ [that is] a figment of the Western imagination.‚Äù Wente's point is, in part, that Hollywood has reduced multinational peoples into one fictional category, ‚ÄúIndian.‚Äù[^15]

### Witchcraft, shamanism, and other forms of folk magic

Witchcraft in folk horror is often treated as an ancient practice that has been carried on through the centuries, **surviving** despite modernization,[^16] or as something that has been **resurrected** from a time long gone.[^17] It can be part of a region's **pagan past**[^18] or treated as **devil worship**. We might differentiate these latter films from ones in which the Devil literally appears.[^20]

[^16]: *The City of the Dead* (1960, UK), *Don't Torture a Duckling* (1972, Italy), *Alison's Birthday* (1981, Australia).
[^17]: *The Wicker Man* (1972, UK).
[^18]: *Lokis* (1970, Poland), *The Juniper Tree* (1990, Iceland), *November* (2017, Estonia).
[^19]: *H√§xan* (1922, Sweden), *The Witches* (1966, UK), *Viy* (1967, USSR), *Witchfinder General* (1968, UK), *Witchhammer* (1970, Czechoslovakia), *History of the Occult* (2020, Argentina).
[^20]: *The Devil and Daniel Webster* (1941, US), *Satan's Feats in the Village of Leva-e-Traz* (1967, Brazil), *Blood on Satan's Claw* (1971, UK), *Nazareno Cruz and the Wolf* (1975, Argentina), *The Legend of Hillbilly John* (1974, US), *Born of Fire* (1987, UK).

Shamans also feature in folk horror films, especially films from cultures with shamanic traditions, such as *The White Reindeer* (1952, Finland), *Io Island* (1977, South Korea), and *The Medium* (2021, Thailand).

Other forms of folk magic, including **hoodoo** (often mistakenly referred to as "voodoo"),[^21] **rootwork**, and **brujeria**, also appear in films like *I Walked with a Zombie* (1943, US), *The Amulet of Ogum* (1974, Brazil), *Voodoo Black Exorcist* (1974, Spain), *Angel Heart* (1987, US), *The Believers* (1987, US), and *The Serpent and the Rainbow* (1988, US).

### Cults

Isolated religious communities develop **extreme beliefs and practices** in films like *Eye of the Devil* (1966, UK), *Crowhaven Farm* (1970, US), *The Wicker Man* (1972, UK), *Children of the Corn* (1984, US), *The Dark Secret of Harvest Home* (1978, US), *Alison's Birthday* (1981, Australia), *Apostle* (2018, US), *Midsommar* (2019, US), and *Incantation* (2022, Taiwan).

### Human sacrifice

Cults and other religious groups **ritualistically kill** one or more humans (or at least try to) for the benefit of the community in films like *Witchfinder General* (1968, UK), *The Lottery* (1969, US), *Blood on Satan's Claw* (1971, UK), *The Wicker Man* (1972, UK), *The Ritual* (2017, UK), *Tumbbad* (2018, India), and *Midsommar* (2019, US).

### Animal transformation

Both women and men transform into various animals, including **bears**,[^22] **cats**,[^23] **reindeer**,[^24] **wolves**,[^25] and **llamas**.[^26] The transformation is often the result of a curse (as opposed to a bite).

[^22]: *Lokis* (1970, Poland).
[^23]: The Japanese ghost cat films, including *Black Cat Mansion*; (1958), *Bakeneko* (1968), and *Kuroneko* (1968).

[^26]: *The Light on the Hill* (2016, Peru).

### Vampirism

Folk horror's vampires are less Dracula and more Nosferatu‚Äînot sleek and urbane but **monstrous** and **animalistic**.[^27] The major exception to this is *Ganja & Hess* (1973, US).

[^27]: *The White Reindeer* (1952, Finland), *Valerie and Her Week of Wonders* (1970, Czechoslovakia), *Leptirica* (1973, Yugoslavia).

### Vengeful ghosts

Culturally-specific versions of the vengeful ghost appear in films like *Bakeneko: A Vengeful Spirit* (1968, Japan), *The Rites of May* (1976, Philippines), *Sundelbolong* (1981, Indonesia), *Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam* (2004, Malaysia), *Demon* (2015, Poland), and *La Llorona* (2019, Guatemala).

## ‚õìÔ∏è Folk horror chain

Adam Scovell's "folk horror chain" is a narrative theory that suggests folk horror films are united by "a linking set of narrative traits that have causational and interlinking consequences."[^28] The four elements of the folk horror chain are:

- Landscape
	- Folk horror films emphasize the landscape in which they are set.
- Isolation
	- The landscape leads to the isolation of the characters.
- Skewed morals
	- Isolation leads to a skewed sense of morals or beliefs.
- The happening
	- The skewed morals or beliefs of the community lead to a happening (often a summoning).
