**Film history** has traditionally been told as a story of Great Men who invented the technology and created the innovations that moved the medium forward. This "traditional" history—still actively taught in film programs—leaves out women and people of color, distorting our perceptions of who makes movies and how they do it.

The version of history presented here attempts to avoid that distortion. It is a work in progress.
