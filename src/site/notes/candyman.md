***The film's iconic title screen, showing an overhead shot of Chicago***

Based on Clive Barker's short story "The Forbidden", the film follows a Chicago graduate student completing a thesis on urban legends and folklore, which leads her to the legend of the "Candyman", the ghost of an African-American artist and son of a slave who was murdered in the late 19th century for his relationship with the daughter of a wealthy white man.

With its narrative focus on folklore being collected by an outsider who has come into an isolated community, *Candyman* can be characterized as a [[topics/folkhorror\|folk horror]] film. Kier-La Janisse, in her documentary *Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched*, explains, "Typically we would reserve the term folk horror for stories that take place in rural environments, but I think a strong case can be made for *Candyman* as a folk horror film because of its liminality, the pyscho-geographical pull of the Cabrini-Green housing project itself, and how that connects back to the Reconstruction-era folktale."

## 🪝 Plot

The film opens with an overhead shot of urban Chicago, titles superimposed over top, and a Phillip Glass score that one might describe as "stabbing." The camera travels laterally, following an eight lane highway through an urban environment almost totally devoid of greenery. Grey concrete dominates the frame.
  
Smash cut to thousands of bees, creating an almost abstract composition that buzzes and seethes with movement. A deep voice, mixed to sound incredibly close to us, begins to speak: "They will say that I have shed innocent blood. What's blood for, if not for shedding?"

Helen is smoking. In voiceover, a girl begins to tell a story, which she calls the scariest one she's ever heard. It's the story of two suburban kids, which we see in flashback—the girl is babysitting and invites over a guy who is not her boyfriend. They are about to have sex, but instead the girl summons Candyman in the mirror and gets killed. The boy, Billy, got away but went crazy; the interviewee says her sister's boyfriend knew him.

On the campus of the University of Illinois—Chicago, Helen arrives to a large lecture hall where a class is in progress. A tweedy professor in his early 40s is asking students about alligators in the sewers. "These stories are modern oral folklore."

Helen, it turns out, is not a student in the course but rather the professor's wife, pursuing a graduate degree in semiotics. Suggestion of cheating husband.

Professor has ruined Helen's thesis project by tainting the interviewee pool with his urban legends lecture.

Helen is transcribing interviews. A janitor comes in to clean. She has heard of Candyman, she says he lives at Cabrini-Green. She calls her friend in who lives there.

Henrietta Mosley and Kitty Culver (sp). Kitty tells a story about a woman in bath who heard banging. Ruthie Jean. She called 911 twice but they didn't believe her. helen asks was she shot? Kitty says no, she was killed a hook.

Helen is in the library looking at newspapers on microfiche. She finds stories about Ruthie Jean.

Helen and Bernadette talking. "My apartment was built as a housing project." Helen opens the curtains on a huge window and explains that after her building was built, the city realized that there was no barrier between the building and the Gold Coast. Bernadette points out that Cabrini-Green is boxed in by the highway and the L train, "cutting the ghetto off." Helen explains that they covered the cinder block and sold the whole building as condos. She demonstrates that her medicine cabinet can be removed from the wall, leading to the medicine cabinet of the empty condo next door.

Helen and Bernadette say Candyman four times in the mirror. Helen leans in and whispers the name one more time. later that night in bed, she is scared by her husband appearing out of nowhere.

Helen and Bernadette are driving to Cabrini-Green. Bernadette is checking her pepper spray and taser. Helen objects. They argue, but decide to stick to their plan.

They arrive at Cabrini-Green, and are catcalled by a group of young Black men who tell them they can't enter. They brush past them and take the stairs up. Helen pulls out a camera and starts taking photos of the graffiti. A brick wall reads "Sweets to the sweet" in huge letters. They enter an empty apartment. Helen says the layout of the unit is identical to her own, so she knows where the bathroom is. Bernadette complains that a woman died in there so they shouldn't go in. This is the apartment where Ruthie Jean was murdered.

Helen opens the medicine cabinet, which has no back to it, and looks into the apartment next door. She climbs through and begins exploring and taking photos. The apartment is dark, the walls don't make sense.

She runs out of photos just before she climbs through a hole in the wall. The other side of the wall features a huge mural of a black man's face. The hole in the wall is his wide-open mouth.

She finds candy with a razor blade in it. She comes back to Bernadette

Anne Marie comes into the apartment and tells the women that they shouldn't be there. Helen introduces them and gives Anne Marie her card. "Whites don't never come here except to cause us a problem."

In the apartment, Anne Marie asks if their study will be about how the residents of Cabrini-Green are all criminals and drug addicts. She is holding her baby, Anthony. Helen helps her clean up a bit of spit up.

Anne Marie asks if they want to know about Ruthie Jean. Newspapers and cops have all been there to ask about it. Anne Marie says she heard the screaming and called 911, but no one came. She says she is scared for her child. "They ain't never going to catch him." Helen asks who? "Candyman."

Later, Helen and Bernadette are at a fancy restaurant with Helen's husband and another professor. Bernadette lets slip that they went to Cabrini. The professor says he wrote a paper about Candyman ten years ago. He asks if they know the story, then laughs meanly when Helen says no. We cut in to a close up of the professor's face as he launches into the story:

>  The legend first appeared in 1890. Candyman was the son of a slave. His father had amassed a considerable fortune from designing a device for the mass-producing of shoes after the Civil War. Candyman had been sent to all the best schools and had grown up in polite society. He had a prodigious talent as an artist and was much sought after when it came to the documenting of one's wealth and position in society in a portrait. It was in this latter capacity that he was commissioned by a wealthy landowner to capture his daughter's virginal beauty. Well, of course, they fell deeply in love, and she became pregnant. Hmph. Poor Candyman. The father executed a terrible revenge. He paid a pack of brutal hooligans to do the deed. They chased Candyman through the town to Cabrini-Green, where they proceeded to saw off his right hand with a rusty blade. No one came to his aid. But this was just the beginning of his ordeal. Nearby there was an apiary. Dozens of hives, filled with hungry bees. They smashed the hives and stole the honeycomb, and smeared it over his prone, naked body. Candyman was stung to death by the bees. They burned his body on a giant pyre and then scattered his ashes over Cabrini-Green.

Helen watches with a dramatic slash of light right over her eyes. Sounds of the scene being described begin to play in the background—screaming, thrashing, the buzzing of bees.

Smash cut back to Cabrini and the mural, which Helen has returned to photograph. She meets a boy in the hallway named Jake. Helen asks him about Ruthie Jean, but Jake says he can't say anything, "or Candyman will get me." He tells Helen she is crazy to walk into Cabrini on her own. Helen says Jake can just show her where Candyman is, unless he is too scared. This works; he starts leading her somewhere.

In a desolate empty lot between the buildings, a pile of wooden furniture and other junk is heaped at least 20 feet in the air. Helen asks if someone is building a bonfire. Jake says it is "for the party."

Whenever we see the outside of Cabrini-Green, the soundtrack brings in dramatic choral voices, almost chanting.

Jake brings her to another part of the housing project, and points to a brick bathroom building where he says a boy was attacked. The boy's genitals were cut off. A man who ran to see what happened was scared and his hair turned white. We get a flashback illustration of the story that appears to be set in the 70s.

Helen goes into the bathroom, which smells horrible and is in total disrepair. One wall and a stall read "sweets to the sweet," with an arrow pointing to a toilet. Unlike the other graffiti, this appears to be written in viscera. Helen opens it and finds it is full of bees.

A man walks by Jake, who says "Candyman." The man enters the bathroom and reveals that he is holding a hook in his hand. Some of the young black men we have seen before enter the bathroom and grab Helen. The man with the hook bashes her in the face.

At a police station, Helen is watching a lineup of Black men. She identifies the man who attacked her in the bathroom. One of her eyes is swollen shut.

"All of Cabrini's locked down now." Cop says the man killed Ruthie Jean and the boy, but that they couldn't find anyone to testify until Helen.

Helen consoles Jake that he won't have to testify in court and that Candyman isn't real.

Weeks later, Helen greets her husband. Her face is mostly healed. He is standoffish.

Bernadette and Helen at UIC. Bernadette has gotten a friend in the art department to save the photos from Helen's smashed camera and print them as slides. She says a publisher is interested in their thesis work, since Helen made the newspaper. She hands off the slides and leaves Helen in a parking garage.

Helen walks through the garage looking at the pictures. Cut to a man's dress shoes and the very bottom of a luxurious looking coat. The man calls Helen's name, sounding as though he is speaking directly into Helen's mind:

"Be my victim. I am the writing on the wall, the whisper in the classroom. Without these things, I am nothing. So now I must shed innocent blood. Come with me."

Helen wakes up in a bathroom covered in blood. Someone is screaming and crying. We are in Anne Marie's apartment and there are pools of blood everywhere. Helen leaves the bathroom and finds Anne Marie's dog beheaded. Anne Marie is screaming "Anthony" and shaking his crib. Everything is so bloody. Anne Marie attacks Helen. Helen cuts Anne Marie to get her to stop attacking. Police burst in and arrest her.

In a police station, a female cop is telling Helen to take over her blood-soaked clothes. Helen cries and begs to take a shower, to speak to the detective she talked to earlier.

Later the cops tell Helen what they think happened.

Helen calls her husband but it goes to voice mail. She asks the cop what time it is. 3 am.

A strobing light illuminates the empty Cabrini apartment, apparently in some sort of vision of Helen's. She sees baby Anthony, unharmed, swaddled and set on a piece of furniture. Candyman is nearby, brandishing his hook hand. The vision ends.

Back at home, a lawyer tells Helen that the cops are hoping to find a body, so they can charge her with murder I. Helen says she can't remember anything that happened, because she blacked out.

Helen is in the bath. Trevor says he has to go to the school to pick up some work, and that he will only be gone for 20 minutes.

Out of the bath, Helen gets a beer from the fridge and lights a cigarette. She pulls out the slides of her photos and inspects them, first holding them up to the light and then projecting them onto the wall of her condo. She stops on a photo of herself in a mirror. Adjusting the focus reveals that Candyman can be seen reflected behind her in the mirror.

Helen goes into her bathroom and Candyman's hand breaks through the medicine cabinet.

"Your disbelief destroyed the faith of my congregation." Candyman says he had to come because of it, and that if Helen doesn't come with him, he will kill baby Anthony.

Bernadette rings the bell outside Helen's front door. She lets herself in and comes face to face with Candyman. We hear the sounds of Bernadette being slit open. Trevor arrives back at home to find Helen covered in blood and holding a kitchen knife.

Helen wakes up in her bed, handcuffed and watched by cops. She runs into the living room and sees Bernadette's body.

"Why do you want to live?" Candyman asks in voiceover. The sound design of his hypnotic voice is so good.

Helen sees the empty Cabrini apartment, the shrine to Candyman. The walls drip blood. Anthony cries. We look through a hole in the wall to a bloody, wet cinder block wall opposite (womb imagery).

Helen is institutionalized. Candyman floats down to Helen from the ceiling and asks for a kiss.

Back to Cabrini, for real this time, not in Helen's mind. Anthony is crying, so Candyman feeds him drops of blood from his mangled stump.

Helen in the institution being wheeled from one room to the office of Dr. Burke. She wants to speak to her husband. The doctor tells her she has been in the hospital for a month, as they stabilize her on a heavy dose of thorazine. She has been charged with first degree murder. he asks what happened in her apartment, but she can't or won't speak. he shows her survellance video from her first night, when she saw Candyman. he does not appear on the video. Helen realizes she may have actually killed Bernadette herself, but says, "No part of me, no matter how hidden, is capable of that."

She says she can prove it, by calling Candyman. She looks over into a convenient mirror and starts to say his name. The doctor is unimpressed. But then he spits blood—Candyman has hooked him from behind and started splitting him open. Candyman frees Helen and tells her that she is his now. He flies through the window.

An alarm sounds, so Helen escapes out the open window. She inches her way to another room, banging on the window for a nurse to let her in. She knocks the nurse out and steals her uniform. The chanting is back, this time taking us from the hospital elevator to helen's condo building. She begs from Trevor to be home.

She opens the door to her condo and finds it is in the process of being painted pepto pink. Trevor's college student is painting the walls. Helen tells her to leave. The girl calls for Trevor, who calls her "sweetiepie" as he enters. He has moved on hella fast and let this child take over his life.

Helen leaves. Organ music drones as she looks at the river. Candyman: "They will all abandon you. All you have left is my desire for you."

Cabrini. Helen avoids the gang and goes back into Ruthie Jean's apartment. She crawls into Candyman's shrine which is still dripping blood. There are candles lit on every surface and a hook hanging from a chain. She climbs up a stack of broken furniture and into the apartment above, where she finds a different style mural, this one depicting Candyman's torture and death in the late 19th century.

Candyman sleeps on a slab of concrete. Helen approaches with the hook, smaller than his. She stabs him in the chest, waking him up. Teh camera swirls around them and she collapses into his arms. he lays her on another slab and drags his hook up her leg, under her skirt.

The bees scene. Candyman opens his coat to reveal a bare, bloody ribcage filled with bees.

He takes the baby. "You're mine now. It's time for a new miracle." Is he speaking to Helen or the baby?

Helen wakes up. The wall now reads "It was always you, Helen." She appears to be painted into the mural, as Candyman's lover. She stumbles outside and realizes Anthony has been placed in the wooden heap, which has still not been turned into a bonfire.

Jake hears the commotion of Helen trying to climb the heap. he looks out his window and mistakes the hook Helen is still carrying for candyman's. "He's here." People start to gather with gasoline, throwing it on the bonfire-to-be.

Helen has found Anthony in the pile and tries to soothe him. The residents of Cabrini continue to gather, surrounding the trash heap and lighting it on fire. Candyman holds Helen in the middle of the fire, telling her they are already dead. She is mad that he tricked her by dooming Anthony to die in the fire too.

Helen stabs him with a burning two by four and crawls, on fire, out of the trash labyrinth. She has Anthony and gives him back to Anne Marie. The fire has burned off her hair and destroyed most of her skin. Candyman explodes into a swarming of burning bees.

Helen's funeral, which Trevor attends with his child girlfriend. She was Catholic. The residents of Cabrini arrive to the funeral in a huge procession, led by Anne Marie, Anthony, and Jake. Jake throws Candyman's hook into her grave, where it bounces off her coffin.

Later, Trevor is at home in the bathroom, looking distraught. His child girlfriend is wearing a see-through white shirt and no bra. She asks if he's okay, like they didn't just attend his wife's funeral. Trevor flashes back to how great Helen was, while his girlfriend angrily cuts up some steaks in the kitchen. Trevor says Helen's name five times in the mirror and she appears behind him, brandishing candyman's hook. she is beautiful but disfigured from the fire. She guts him.

The girlfriend goes back to the bathroom and finds it sprayed with blood, Trevor dead.

A mural of Helen, dressed in white and wreathed in flame, has appeared on a wall in Cabrini. Credits roll.

## 🌆 Themes

### Racialized communities and identities
The character of Candyman can be seen as the kind of “Africanist presence” Toni Morrison writes about in *Playing in the Dark*—that is, a fictional African-American character created by a white writer to embody "a fabricated brew of darkness, otherness, alarm, and desire that is uniquely American."[^2]

[^2]: Toni Morrison. *Playing in the Dark*. Publisher, year.

### Sacrifice zones
Multiple characters mention that the cops rarely if ever respond to 911 calls from Cabrini-Green.

> *Candyman* suggests that oral storytelling and by extension, urban legends, are valuable forms of historical memory, and that the process of historical amnesia will be apocalyptic.
> 
> — Kirsten Moana Thompson

*Candyman*'s main character, Helen, is a grad student writing a thesis on urban legends and folklore, who comes to Cabrini-Green as an [[ethnographer\|outsider]] to collect stories. This parallels both the real history of folklore studies and the plots of other folk horror films like *Lokis A Manuscript of Professor Wittembach|Lokis: A Manuscript of Professor Wittembach*.

John Cussans from *Woodlands Dark*: "What we often find... the central protagonist is someone who's studying or researching or is educated, and they don't really believe in it, but they're deeply interested in it, and their fascination becomes part of their undoing."[^3]

## ❔ Student-generated discussion questions
The following questions were written by students in [[Genre in Film\|Genre in Film]] during fall 2024.

- *Candyman* has been criticized because of its white director and for the use of a white protagonist in a movie that is centered around issues surrounding the deeply marginalized black community. How does this film use Africanist elements through the characters in this film?
- Professor Lyle says that campfire/bedtime stories are modern oral folklore and that “they are the un-self-conscious reflection of the fears of urban society.” What do you believe he means by that? Are there examples of that in this film? What is an example of modern oral folklore of today?
- In folk horror, supernatural elements could be linked to unresolved histories, trauma, or sins of a community. How is the figure of Candyman used as a supernatural embodiment of historical injustices? Can Candyman be seen as a “folk avenger” whose presence serves as a reminder of generational pain and societal neglect?

## 🥈 Sequels
The film was followed by three sequels: *Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh* (1995), *Candyman: Day of the Dead* (1999), and *Candyman* (2021).
